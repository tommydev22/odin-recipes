        <h2>Italian Rigatoni Bolognese Recipe</h2>
        <p>This classic Italian dish originated from Bologna and is now a worldwide dinner favorite. Loved by kids and adults alike, it is packed with hidden veggies disguised in a creamy tomato meat sauce. The slow-simmered sauce begins with tender ground beef, seared to perfection, then melded with a fragrant medley of saut√©ed onion, carrot, and celery, an aromatic trio that forms the foundation of deep, savory goodness.</p>
        <p>Garlic infuses the mixture with warmth before luscious tomatoes and a splash of broth create a velvety, slow-cooked sauce. Just before serving, a touch of whipping cream swirls into the pot, adding a subtle, luxurious richness that clings beautifully to the al dente rigatoni.</p>
        <p>Simple and healthy, this creamy bolognese is perfect for a chilled weekday dinner but will also be welcomed at any dinner party.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 carrots (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery (diced)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (or sausage)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
            <li>28 oz crushed tomatoes (canned)</li>
            <li>14.5 oz beef broth</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 lb rigatoni</li>
            <li>cup whipping cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tbsps of olive oil in a large pot, add the onions, carrot, and celery. Season with a little salt & pepper. Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until soft. Once the vegetables are soft, add the garlic and cook until fragrant - about a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef (and/or sausage if you're using). Cook until browned.
            </li>
            <li>Add the red wine (if using), tomato paste, and Italian seasoning. Mix all together and cook until red wine is cooked off (about 5 minutes) or if not using, until all the paste and seasoning is all combined.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth and bay leaves. Mix all together and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking, heat 4 quarts of water until boiling. Add the pasta when there is about 10 minutes left on the sauce. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the cream to the sauce. Mix all together and cook until cream is heated.</li>
            <li>Serve the rigatoni in bowls and spoon sauce on top! Add some fresh grated parmesan cheese if desired. Buon appetito!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>How much to make.</strong> This recipe will make about 10-12 cups of sauce. Double the recipe for larger gatherings or if you plan on freezing a bunch. Make sure you have a large enough pot if you double though, a 7.5 quart dutch oven will do the trick.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the correct equipment.</strong> Since bolognese is a slow cooked sauce it is best cooked using an iron cast skillet or dutch oven. This will ensure an even and steady temperature throughout since this material holds heat better. More controlled temperature helps you avoid burning your sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right wine.</strong> When choosing your wine opt for a high acidity option so that it is not drowned out by the already acidic tomato paste. Good options include Pino Nior or Chianti Classico. These will ensure their flavor stands out in the recipe. </li>
        <li><strong>Patience. </strong> Take your time! In my eyes, the longer cook time you give to a bolognese the better. Even though you can have this on your dinner table in less than 40 minutes, give yourself a healthy timeframe to cook it in and really allow all the flavors to marinade so you are left with a rich and elegant sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Reheating from frozen.</strong> If you're reheating from frozen, defrost the sauce overnight in the refrigerator and and heat in a sauce pan until hot. </li>
        </ul>
