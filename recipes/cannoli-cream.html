        <h2>How to Make Cannoli Cream</h2>
        <p>Lusciously smooth and irresistibly decadent, this cannoli cream is a dreamy blend of rich ricotta and airy whipped cream, creating the perfect balance of lightness and indulgence. Sweetened with just the right amount of confectioners' sugar, it melts on the tongue with a velvety texture that feels almost sinful.</p>
        <p>A hint of vanilla extract enhances the natural sweetness, infusing each bite with a warm, aromatic depth. Tiny chocolate chips are scattered throughout, adding delightful bursts of richness that contrast beautifully with the creamy, cloud-like filling. The chocolate chips add just the right amount of texture, a playful crunch amidst the smoothness, making this cannoli cream as delightful as it is addictive. Whether served as a dip, a filling, or a standalone treat, it promises to satisfy every sweet tooth with its classic Italian charm.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>15 oz ricotta cheese; whole milk, strained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup mini chocolate chips; milk or dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the whipping cream into a large mixing bowl. Start whisking by hand. Slow to start at first and then pick up the speed as the cream begins to thicken. Whisk until you have a nice, thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Transfer the cream to a small bowl and set aside. In the same large mixing bowl, add the strained ricotta cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Using the electronic mixer, start mixing until it's all mixed together.</li>
            <li>Once mixed, add the whipped cream and the chocolate chips. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cream to a pastry bag or gallon-sized plastic bag (with the corner tip cut).</li>
            <li>Fill each side of the cannolis.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drain the Ricotta.</strong> Ricotta cheese contains a lot of moisture, which can make the cream too runny. Drain it in a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth for at least a few hours (or overnight) for a thicker, smoother consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Full-Fat Ricotta.</strong> Low-fat versions can be grainy and watery, so always opt for full-fat ricotta for the best texture and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Hand whip the cream.</strong> There is such a thing as "overwhipping" the cream which essentially turns into a consistency more like butter. Whipping by hand, versus using a hand blender, makes it easier for us to control how much we whip and ensure we get the proper texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill Before Using.</strong> Let the finished cream sit in the fridge for at least an hour before piping it into shells to help it firm up and develop flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Donâ€™t Fill Too Early.</strong> To keep cannoli shells crispy, fill them just before serving, or store the cream separately until needed.</li>
        </ul>
