        <h2>How to Make Cannoli Cream</h2>
        <p>Lusciously smooth and irresistibly decadent, this cannoli cream is a dreamy blend of rich ricotta and airy whipped cream, creating the perfect balance of lightness and indulgence. Sweetened with just the right amount of confectioners' sugar, it melts on the tongue with a velvety texture that feels almost sinful. A hint of vanilla extract enhances the natural sweetness, infusing each bite with a warm, aromatic depth. Tiny chocolate chips are scattered throughout, adding delightful bursts of richness that contrast beautifully with the creamy, cloud-like filling.</p>
        <p>Perfect for piping into crisp cannoli shells, layering between delicate pastries, or simply enjoyed by the spoonful, this luxurious cream is pure dessert bliss. As the whipped cream folds seamlessly into the ricotta, it creates an airy yet luscious consistency that makes every bite feel like a special Italian occasion.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>15 oz ricotta cheese; whole milk, strained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup mini chocolate chips; milk or dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the whipping cream into a large mixing bowl. Start whisking by hand. Slow to start at first and then pick up the speed as the cream begins to thicken. Whisk until you have a nice, thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cream to a small bowl and set aside. In the same large mixing bowl, add the strained ricotta cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Using the electronic mixer, start mixing until it's all mixed together.</li>
            <li>Once mixed, add the whipped cream and the chocolate chips. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cream to a pastry bag or gallon-sized plastic bag (with the corner tip cut).</li>
            <li>Fill each side of the cannolis.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whip the cream by hand. There is actually such a thing as "overwhipping" the cream which essentially turns into a consistency more like butter. Because of this, make sure to whip the cream by hand, instead of using a blender. This just makes it easier to control how much we whip and ensure we get the proper texture we're going for.</li>
            <li>Don't fill the shells too early. Be sure to wait until you're ready to eat the cannolis before filling the shells. Filling the shells too early will make the shell soggy and you'll lose the crunch which provides the perfect contrast to the smooth, creamy filling inside.</li>
        </ul>
