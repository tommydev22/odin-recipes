        <h2>Chicken and Kale Casserole Recipe</h2>
        <p>Golden, bubbling, and irresistibly creamy, this chicken and rice casserole is the epitome of comfort food with a touch of elegance. Tender shreds of chicken nestle into fluffy, perfectly cooked rice, all enrobed in a velvety sauce made from milk and Parmesan cheese. The saut√©ed onions add a hint of sweetness, while finely chopped kale melts seamlessly into the dish, bringing a subtle earthiness that balances the richness.
        <p>Topping it all off is a golden layer of crisp, buttery breadcrumbs infused with Parmesan, creating the perfect contrast to the creamy base beneath. As it bakes, the cheese melds into the breadcrumbs, forming a crunchy, savory crust that shatters with each bite, releasing a tantalizing aroma of toasted cheese and roasted onion.
        <p>The warmth of the dish fills the air, making it impossible to resist that first spoonful. Whether served for a cozy weeknight dinner or a gathering of loved ones, this casserole is a soul-satisfying masterpiece that promises to be the star of any meal.</p>

            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp parmesan cheese grated</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Casserole Spice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp flour all purpose</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice according to the packages instructions. Remove from heat, fluff with a fork, cover and set aside. Also, preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Heat one of the 2 tbsp of olive oil on medium heat in a large fry pan or Dutch oven. When heated, add the onions and cook for about 4-5 minutes until soft and translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the kale to the pan of onions and garlic. Cook, mixing thoroughly until all the kale is fully covered with the oil. Add the flour and whisk until fully mixed in. Then add the casserole spice and cook, mixing frequently until the kale begins to wilt - about 3-4 minutes of cooking.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to high, and slowly whisk in the milk. Cook for about a minute until the milk begins to thicken a bit, then slowly whisk in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Drop the heat and simmer for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken and the cooked rice and toss everything together until fully combined. Cook for 1-2 minutes until heated through.</li>
            <li>While the chicken and rice heat up in the pan. In a medium sized bowl, add your breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese and mix together. Slowly whisk in the last 2 tbsps of olive oil (you may need more depending on your preferred texture), stirring as you pour. Add enough of olive oil until all the breadcrumbs are covered with oil and the mixture is moist.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, rice, and kale mixture to a large baking dish, and spread evenly. One spoonful at a time, top the chicken and rice with the breadcrumb mixture until the entire casserole is covered.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until the breadcrumbs are toasted.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This recipe is more than enough for my family of 4 with leftovers for lunch the next day (depending on how much your family eats, maybe even two days). If you're just looking for dinner for 2 or a light family meal, you can cut this recipe in half and have plenty to go around.</li>
        </ul>
